## Ideas

- Bulk ATE estimation for most frequent drugs administered
- Individualized BP targets
- explore drugs with heterogenous ITE 
  - identification -> ITE estimation in bulk for most common drugs -> measure heterogeneity in ITE
  - build recommender model

## Explorative / descriptive data analysis

#### Analysis of subgroups given treatment sequence and outcome

- group treatment as sequence
- in a given sequence -> group by outcome
- look at subgroups with a given outcome and a given treatment sequence

#### Bayesian treatment given initial state

- group treatment as sequence
Given initial state, what is the probability of outcome given a treatment sequence?

#### Explore treatment response subgroups

- classify subgroups into no response, positive response, negative response
  - delta NIHSS as response variable: constant, improvement, worsening
- then look at treatment sequence in each subgroup
